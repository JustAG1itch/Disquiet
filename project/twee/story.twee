:: Scene 1: In your house
You’re in your house late at night doing homework
You start hearing strange noises 
What do you do?

:: Scene 2: Nightmare awakes you
The clock chimes. It is now 2:00 AM.
It's still raining outside, but that isn't what wakes you up.
FRIEND
It's dark when you open your eyes. At some point in the night the power must have gone out, plunging the house into complete darkness. You can barely make out anything in front of you.
HELLO FRIEND
DID YOU MISS ME
Including the incomprehensible shape  hovering directly over the couch.

:: Scene 2b Freeze
You freeze like a cornered animal. Every muscle in your body locks up as the shape drifts closer like a black cloud, close enough to touch the tip of your nose. 
DIDN’T I TELL YOU I’D BE BACK
I TOLD YOU
I TOLD YOU
I TOLD YOU
I’LL NEVER LEAVE YOU
Each word is like a stake through your temples and a knife in your heart. Your breath sticks in your throat; trying to catch it just twists the knife further.

<<set $scene_2b_key to true>>

:: Scene 2c Shut your eyes
I CAN STILL SEE YOU
It isn't quite a voice, but it's something you hear in the back of your head all the same, throbbing against the walls of your skull like a migraine.
[[Go back|Scene 2: Nightmare awakes you]]
<<set $scene_2c_key to true>>

:: Scene 3: Run (BRANCH SPLIT)
You regain control of your body and roll off the couch, hitting the ground with a thud. Crawling forward, you scramble to your feet, trying not to slide on the floor as you run.
Your only choice is obvious.

:: Scene 4: Hide
This is your house. You know it better than anyone and where the best places are to hide.
Choose a hiding spot

:: Scene 5a: The Basement
You run into the kitchen, blindly groping around for the walls, a chair, anything to help you as you feel your way to the corner of the room. Your hand hits the handle of the door to the cellar, and you yank it open so fast you feel like you could tear the hinges off.
Not that you could tear it off, of course. You’re not that strong, and certainly not strong enough to fight back, are you?
You shut the door behind you and go downstairs, two steps at a time. There’s only one window in the cellar and it’s tiny, about the size and width of a shoebox. Not even close to being big enough for you to fit through. A flash of lightning illuminates the musty-smelling room where you can see piles of newspapers, old sports equipment, and boxes filled with toys you haven’t looked at since you were a child.
You beeline for the spot tucked behind the stairs, conceal yourself behind a box of old clothes, and listen.
You can hear something moving around upstairs. The floorboards creak softly, stop, and start again. They stop one more time.
Very slowly, the door to the cellar creaks open, so quiet you can only hear it when you hold your breath. You can still hear it over the hammer of your heartbeat, drowning out the world. 
FRIEND
I FOUND YOU

BAD END

:: Scene 5b (The Closet)
You enter the hallway between your bedroom and the living room, running past the grandfather clock. You don’t hear it ticking anymore, as if time itself has stopped moving.
The room to your door is already open. Good. It won’t be able to tell you’re in here.
You shut yourself in your closet, hide under a pile of laundry, and listen.
You can hear something crawling across the floor, moving so stealthily you might miss the sound entirely compared to the ragged breathing coming from your throat. The scant light from under the door goes out.
 DON’T SCREAM FRIEND DON’T CRY FRIEND DON’T FIGHT FRIEND
I WILL ALWAYS BE HERE

:: Scene 5c (Under the bed)
You enter the hallway between your bedroom and the living room, running past the grandfather clock. You don’t hear it ticking anymore, as if time itself has stopped moving.
The room to your door is already open. Good. It won’t be able to tell you’re in here.
You crawl under your bed, tuck your arms and legs in, and shut your eyes.
Two seconds pass, then three. Then ten. Twenty. You start to breathe again.
Then you hear the bed springs squeak above your head. 
YOU CANNOT HIDE FRIEND

:: Scene 6: Run Outside
You have a feeling that you wouldn’t get very hard if you tried to hide. So you decide to run. 
Prompt: Run across the street
